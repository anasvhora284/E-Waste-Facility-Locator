# E-Waste Facility Locator

## Overview

The E-Waste Facility Locator is a web application designed to help users locate e-waste disposal facilities. This project is divided into two main components: the frontend and the backend.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Contains the client-side code for the web application.
- **Backend**: Contains the server-side code and API endpoints.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (including npm)

## Running the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your configuration).

## Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The backend server will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your configuration).

## Configuration

Make sure to configure environment variables and any other settings as required for both the frontend and backend. Check the `.env.example` files in each directory for reference and create your own `.env` files with the appropriate configurations.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the backend server is running before starting the frontend application.
- For production deployment, additional steps and configurations may be required.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the following:

- Verify that Node.js and npm are correctly installed.
- Ensure there are no port conflicts.
- Review error messages in the terminal for clues.
